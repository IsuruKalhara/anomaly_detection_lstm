# Anomaly Detection in S&P 500 index with Keras

Anomaly detection model using deep learning. Training an LSTM autoencoder using the Keras API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index. Program will also create interactive charts and plots using Plotly Python and Seaborn for data visualization and display the results in Jupyter notebook.
